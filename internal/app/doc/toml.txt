The core components of `{{ $.Executable }}` are controlled via
environment settings, but these settings are secondary (overriden)
by TOML configuration file(s) if given. Run `{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.HelpCommand }} {{ $.HelpConfigCommand
}}` for more information.

- TOML values are read, transformed, and set into the process
environment.

- Arrays defined within the TOML configuration are flattened into
a string (space delimited), quoting should be done within array
parameters when needed.
