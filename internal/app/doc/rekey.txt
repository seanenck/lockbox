The password store can have the key (and file) changed via the '{{ $.ReKeyCommand }}'
subcommand. This command requires that a combination of new key
settings are configured via user input (unless `{{ $.ReKey.NoKey }}` is set) and '{{ $.ReKey.KeyFile }}'
depending on the new database credential preferences. 

Note that is an advanced feature and should be used with caution/backups/etc.
