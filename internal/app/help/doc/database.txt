While '{{ $.Executable }}' uses a kdbx file (version 4), it is opinionated about how to store
data within the file. This means '{{ $.Executable }}' should be the only way a user normally
interacts with or changes the underlying database. However as the file is a 
normal kdbx file format (e.g. can be opened in tools supporting the format) it
is possible to use the database in those applications, just take caution when
changing it outside of '{{ $.Executable }}' usage. If a database not normally used by '{{ $.Executable }}' is
to be used by '{{ $.Executable }}', try using the various readonly settings to control
interactions.
