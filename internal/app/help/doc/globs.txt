The '{{ $.RemoveCommand }}' and '{{ $.MoveCommand }}' command can handle a simplistic glob if it is at the END
of the path. This allows for bulk-removal of entries at multiple levels.
Confirmation will still be required for removal (matching entries will be
listed).

For '{{ $.MoveCommand }}' the destination must NOT be an entry but the final destination
location for all matched entries. Overwriting is not allowed by moving
via glob and moving via globs can ONLY be done via leaf level globs.

Examples:

{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.RemoveCommand }} path/to/leaf/dir/*

{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.RemoveCommand }} path/to/*

{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.MoveCommand }} path/to/* new/path/
